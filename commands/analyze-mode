Please analyze the alias mode file {{MODE_NAME}} in the aliases/ directory and provide:

1. A summary of what this mode is for
2. List each alias with a brief explanation
3. Any suggestions for improving the aliases (shorter names, better organization, etc.)
4. Whether there are any potential conflicts or security concerns

If the mode doesn't exist, list the available modes instead.
